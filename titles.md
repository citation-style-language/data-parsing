title: Title Parsing

# Introduction

This includes examples of how to parse titles.

# Basic Title and Subtitle

Generally speaking, title are linked to subtitles using colons, or in some cases period.

```
Title: The Subtitle
```

# Alternate Delimeters

Titles can also end in exclamation or question marks:

```
The Way Forward? An Exploration of Foo
```


# Multiple Subtitles


# Double-Bar Recommendation

There are rare times when these conventions might not work. 
For these situations, we suggest using a convention of splitting on double bars:

```
Title and || a non-standard subtitle
```
